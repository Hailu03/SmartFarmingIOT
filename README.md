# Smart Farming IoT

Smart Farming IoT is an Internet of Things (IoT) application designed to monitor and manage various environmental parameters for a smart farm. The system collects sensor data such as temperature, air humidity, soil humidity, luminosity, pH level, and wind speed, and displays it on a web interface in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of environmental parameters.
- Automatic data updates on the web interface.
- Data storage using PostgreSQL.
- RESTful API for receiving sensor data.
- Web interface built with Express and EJS.
